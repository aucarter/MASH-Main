1. Overview
-------------
MicroMacroMalariaSim is a stochastic individual mosquito and individual human based malaria transmission simulator. MicroMacroMalariaSim has two components: 
. Individual humans - individual mosquitoes based MicroSim
. Individual humans based MacroSim
 

2. Instructions for Compilation
--------------------------------
. Unzip the files in a folder 
. To compile run the following command from the software root folder
	> make
. The above command would make two excutables called MicroSim and MacroSim.
. To compile individual component use following command:
	> make <component>
	e.g.:
	> make MicroSim
. Compiling the code produces some intermediate object files stored inside obj folder
. Intermediate object files can be deleted by following command
	> make clean

2. Input Files
---------------
MicroSim and MacroSim work on their individual input files. Following sections give information about the input files. Sample input files are provided in the folder named data.

2.1 MicroSim
. The simulator needs the following input files place under the same directory.
	1. default.in (configuration file): contains the simulation parameters
	2. default.patches: contains the information about the patches
	3. default.houses: contains the information about the houses
	4. default.humans: contains the information about the humans
	5. default.ponds: contains the information about the ponds
	6. default.lambda: contains the information about the daily lambdas
	
2.2 MacroSim
. The simulator needs the following input files place under the same directory.
	1. macro.in (configuration file): contains the simulation parameters
	2. macro.patches: contains the information about the patches
	3. macro.humans: contains the information about the humans
	4. macro.lambda: contains the information about the daily lambdas
	5. macro.infections (optional): contains information about patch-wise initial population infected


3. Instructions for execution
------------------------------
The two components of the simulator can be executed individually. 

3.1 MicroSim

	> ./MicroSim -d <path_to_directory_containing_input_data_files> 
	or
	> ./MicroSim -d <path_to_directory_containing_input_data_files> -o <path_to_output_directory>
	
	directory paths need '/' or '\' character at the end depending on the operating system.
	
	. MicroSim needs all the input data files to pe placed in the same folder. 
	E.g. if the input data files are placed in /home/user1/data then the command should be

	> ./MicroSim -d /home/user1/data/
	Or
	> ./MicroSim -d data/
	if there is a directory named data present in the same folder as MalariaSim
	
	To specify the output directory switch -o could be used. E.g.
	> ./MicroSim -d data/ -o simoutfiles/

3.2 MacroSim
	> ./MacroSim path_to_configuration_file
	E.g. if the configuration input file is placed in /home/user1/data then the command should be

	> ./MacroSim /home/user1/macro.in
	
	An extra string could be appended to the name of output files using extra argument as follows:
	> ./MacroSim /home/user1/macro.in <outStringAppend>

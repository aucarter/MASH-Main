In MBITES, oogenesis (egg development) is called during
mbites_updateState, if a mosquito is bloodfed. Two models for
oogenesis have been developed. In the first model, called
oogenesis1, each batch of eggs matures after some fixed time that
coincides with the duration of the post-prandial resting period.
In this model, the probability of refeeding is computed based
either on the egg batch size or on the blood meal size.  
In the second model, called oogenesis2, each batch of eggs must
be provisioned by a pre-determined amount of blood; refeeding
occurs until the blood resource requirement has been reached.

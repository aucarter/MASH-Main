# Notes

* within the bout, if you want to have the mosquito blood feed or oviposit next bout, set to B or O. At the end of the bout, the mbites algorithm will check automagically if there is the resource there, and if not, then will trip the switch to F or L.
* in `bloodEnergetics` we set mature = TRUE if mated = TRUE but we need to sort out how mating will interact with stuff. should draw some diagrams
*

#' Initialize Generic Methods for M-BITES
#'
#' This function initializes generic methods for M-BITES models; please note that the
#' switches for this function modify only the methods that are added to the \code{\link{MosquitoFemale}}
#' and \code{\link{MosquitoMale}} classes.
#'
#' @param tattering character switch in \code{"mean","exact"}, mean will sample wing tattering from \code{\link{mbitesGeneric_WingTattering}} regardless of flight distance
#' @param energy character switch in \code{"mean","exact"}, mean will sample energy consumption
#' @param batchSize character switch in \code{"bms","norm"} for egg batch sizes dependent on bloodmeal size or normally distributed
#' @param eggMatT character switch in \code{"off","norm"} for egg batch maturation time turned off or normally distributed
#'
#'
#'
#' @return writes methods to \code{\link{MosquitoFemale}} and \code{\link{MosquitoMale}} classes.

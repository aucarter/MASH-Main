# Example usage of vector bionomics calculation scripts for MBITES

#### - Daniel Citron, 6/8/2018

* *Vector_Bionomics_Calculator.R* - this is the script for calculating bionomics based on simulation output
* *Using_Vector_Bionomics_Calculator.R* - this is a script demonstrating how to make (very basic) histograms using the Vector Bionomics Calculator
* *mosquito_F_1.json* - example MBITES simulation output (will not actually produce histograms, but at least the scripts in Using_Vector_Bionomics_Calculator should work fine with them)

* Estimate map of force of infection as a function of
    * 1 - local (area-level) estimates of PfPR
    * 2 - time at risk at home vs. time at risk in other locations
    * Combining these two things allows us to differentiate between locally-acquired and imported cases of malaria
* Area-level estimates of PfPR
    * Based on MIS survey data from 2015-2017 - RDT results
* Time at Risk
    * Based on MIS survey data from 2015-2017 - travel frequency and destination responses
    * Fit travel frequency using a gravity model, where each areaâ€™s travel frequency depends on its local population; the population of the destination; and the distance between the home and destination locations
* Some important caveats:
    * Currently we have travel counts data, but no reports on time spent while traveling in different locations. (2018 MIS should help with this)
    * Currently we treat 6 regions on the island (Malabo, Baney, Luba, Riaba, Moka, Ureka) and mainland EG as destination locations in our travel model.  This is because the travel counts data from 2015-2017 only specifies the region where they traveled to, not where within that region. (2018 MIS should help with this)
    * Currently we are assuming that each group of survey respondents is representative of the area they belong to - our next step is to account for the uncertainty introduced by the survey sampling with a more sophisticated model.
* The PfPR estimates, the travel frequency estimates, and the estimates of time spent at each destination all have associated uncertainties - we can use this framework to propagate these uncertainties through the model

# Cluster Determination

## Methodology

Given a particular population (assumed fully mixed humans and mosquitoes) and known vaccine coverage and efficacy, calculate the effect size and perform power calculations.

* Step 1: Pick the geographical center of a hypothetical cluster
* Step 2: Use kernel to determine population in the hypothetical cluster
* Step 3: Define proposed coverage level and efficacy of vaccine
* Step 4: Calculate estimated effect size
* Step 5: Power calculations - how large a cluster, and how many


This procedure can be iterated many times for different cluster locations, different cluster sizes, and different vaccine coverage criteria.

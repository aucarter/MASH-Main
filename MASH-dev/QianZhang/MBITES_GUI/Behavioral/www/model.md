#### What is MBITES

MBITES is a software package for simulating adult mosquito ecology and behavior. The purpose is to advance the science and analysis for problems related to mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and vector control. Conceptually, MBITES has several parts:

* A **landscape** describing resources used by adult mosquitoes; 

* Algorithms describing adult behavior as a sequence of **flight bouts**; 

* A set of configurable **behavioral options** for simulating other aspects of mosquito life-history and behavior; 

* Related components describing **aquatic ecology**;  

* Options for implementing various types of **vector control**

* Structures and options for simulating **pathogen transmission** among hosts. 

The following sections describe various features of MBITES. Each section begins with a brief summary of the natural history, a description of the heuristic followed by implementation notes, relevant details, and a guide to the code.

# Forest Malaria Summary
### Alec Georgoff

##### Definition of "forest"
Forest is defined as terrain with a tree canopy cover of more than 10% and an area of more than 0.5 hectacres, with a minimum tree height of 5 m

##### Summarizing hidden risks of malaria in forests
Most studies of forest malaria are focused on local factors associated with malaria transmission. These include:
* Distance from forest
* Impact of deforestation and reforestation
* Effect of forest on microclimate
* Vector bionomics
* _Plasmodium_ species survival
* Human activities in forests
 
Malaria eradication/elimination is impractical without prevention of re-introduction/re-emergence from hidden foci/uncontrolled forest malaria
 
The problem of malaria in forests is compounded by hidden reservoirs of malaria infections that are not fully addressed
 
Forest has an influence on:
* Temperature buffering
* Rainfall
* Humidity
* Tree canopy
* Flora & fauna
* High organic content in breeding pools
* Lack of infrastructure

##### Influence of topographic parameters in forested regions
Forests harbor forest-adapted malaria vectors

##### Temperature, rainfall, and humidity
Generally trees in the forests add moisture in the air by transpiration and help in lowering temperature, thus increasing precipitation

##### Vegetation
Vegetation near human habitation increases the population of forest malaria vectors and thus increases malaria transmission

##### Bodies of Water
Mosquitoes mature in bodies of water (their larval habitat) and disperse according to their flight range

##### Deforestation
Reduction of dense tree shade increases exposure of vector breeding sites and resting places to sunlight, hence altering vector habitats
 
It has been predicted that deforestation in central Africa and tropical America might increase malaria, whereas in Asia deforestation would result in reduction in malaria
 
Deforestation affects malaria transmission depending upon the vector diversity of a particular region

##### Impact of forest and forestation on vector abundance
Manmade forests (including significantly large plantation areas) or reforestation also cause habitat change and influence malaria vector abundance leading changes in malaria transmission scenarios

##### Behavior of forest-adapted vector forms
Some non-forest vectors have distinct forest forms
 
Variation in vector forms is accompanied by differences in vectorial capacity, biting habits and differential resistance to insecticides, thus influencing vector control strategies

##### _Plasmodium_ species distribution in forested regions
_Plasmodium_ in humans is little influenced by forest factors, as its secondary lifecycle is completed in a homeothem. However, the primary life cycle occurs in an ectothermic vector, which is very much influenced by environment
 
 _Plasmodium_ species have evolved to fit local vectors
 
##### Risk of primate malaria to humans in forest regions
The presence of a non-human primate _Plasmodium_ species in forest foci poses a constant risk of host switching to nearby human populations due to deforestation
 
The presence of asymptomatic human reservoirs together with infected monkeys could maintain malaria transmission in a situation where routine malaria surveillance and control are difficult

##### Parasite reservoir and drug resistance
Stability of malaria transmission in endemic areas is also reported to be associated with asymptomatic _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ reservoirs
 
The reservoir plays a very important role in bridging transmission seasons
 
_Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ are reported to be more often associated with drug resistance in forested areas where intensity of malaria transmission is higher and malaria control often neglected
 
The forested Thai-Cambodia border is believed to be the "epicenter" for the origin of chloroquine resistance and evolution of multidrug resistance

##### Known malariogenic practices of forest natives
These communities are mostly illiterate, prone to suspicious beliefs, and poor at communicating with malaria control workers

##### Population migration in forest areas
Populations move within and out of the forest for a variety of reasons and this helps in malaria dissemination
 
Such movements increase the contact with efficient malaria vectors when night halt is done in the forest

##### Poor infrastructure and communication
Health infrastructure and surveillance are neglected in remote forest areas
 
The indigenous population generally relies on the health practices of local faith healers and/or quacks
 
It is reported that treatment seeking behavior is inversely related to the distance from a health facility and communication problems

##### People's conceptions and cooperation
Different perceptions about malaria have been reported among tribal groups in different parts of the world
 
Generally poverty is the next most important factor in accessing a distant healthcare facility besides illiteracy, superstition, and cultural faith
 
Surveillance is poor in remote forested areas and presumptive treatment using antimalarials in low doses is taken for all sorts of fever, accelerating the development of drug resistance

##### Suggestions for overcoming major challenges to curbing malaria transmission in forest ecosystems
Forests escape malaria control efforts mainly due to inadequate roads and poor communinication
 
Communication infrastructure development should be the first priority as this will open new ways and opportunity to the inhabitants and boost their socio-economic status
 
In forested borders people often migrate across the borders and carry malaria
 
Tribals in forest areas, often hidden from the outer world, are generally conservative and reluctant in treatment seeking
 
Mass screening may be useful in order to assess malaria sero-positivity among communities where asymptomatic malaria prevails and people are less prompt in seeking treatment
 
Strictly controlled administration of antimalarials with periodic assessment of drug resistance status is suggested in forested areas

#### Conclusions
Malaria transmission in forest areas is a complex process involving interplay between topographical, entomological, parasitological and human factors
 
Based on in-depth understanding of the intricate relationship of various parameters, situation specific vector/malaria control strategies can be developed and implemented to address malaria in the forests

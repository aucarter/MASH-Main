# Networks Analysis Scripts

This is a temporary development folder that holds some network-analysis related routines for the second paper. Please take note that they require _PajaroLoco_ (https://bitbucket.org/chipdelmal/pajarolocopublic) installed.

Most of the ideas so far revolve around clustering geographically and analyzing the transitions between _sinks_ and _sources_ on the movement matrices. For more information see the related channel on *Slack: #mosypopdyn* or drop me a line.

For now, all the routines are coded in _Mathematica_ but they will be ported to *R* or *Python* in the future.

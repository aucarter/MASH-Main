General Infection Process:

1) Patient zero points to an initial pathogen (which has an "alive" flag turned on)
2) Human and pathogen develop normally
3) Upon bite, a mosquito might get infected with the pathogen, if it does:
	a) A new copy of the pathogen is created in a vacant space (in a pathogen in the vector with a flag that identifies it as dead
	b) The mosquito points to the new, independent, pathogen's copy
4) Human/Pathogen and Mosquito/Pathogen are now independent
5) Upon Human/Mosquito death/recovery:
	a) The pathogen is marked as dead
	b) The pointer is removed from the human/mosquito


General notes:
-The pointer towards pathogens must be a pointer array as individuals might be infected by different pathogens or serotypes of the same pathogen at the same time.

How does LOME work? 

1. Infections begin when mosquitoes probe prior to blood feeding.
LOME defines the function probeHost(ixH, spz, t, x, y, MosqPf); 

  ixH :: the index of the host being probed
  spz :: the mosquitoes sporozoite status (TRUE/FALSE)
  t, x, y :: the time and location of the bite
  MosqPf :: an object with information about Pf in the mosquito

The probeHost algorithm does the following

  a. counts the bite (hbr)  
  b. if (spz == TRUE) 
     - counts the infectious bite (eir) 
     - draws a random # of sporozoites passed 
     - determines survival of sporozoites from non-specific responses 
     - identify the clonal recombinant of each SPZ 
     - get the SPZ PE types 
     - reduce # for type-specific PE immunity 
     - count nSPZ reaching the liver 
     - reduce # for type-specific liver immunity 
  c. if(nSPZ>0) add each spz clone to the eventQ and pedigree  

2. The human object activates an infection from the eventQ 
  a. create the time course for the infection & (possibly) queue fever
  3. Modifies the time course of other infections 

3. Updating the model requires 
  1. updateImmunity 
  2. updateInfection 
  3. OPTIONAL: updateHistory 

4. When a mosquito takes a bloodmeal
  1. draw a random number to infect mosquito 
  2. If infected
     a. how many oocysts form?  
     b. return the PfID of each parent

\section{\strong{Description}}{

Generate a single ELP, a simplified model of aquatic ecology which only includes egg and a single larval stage. See \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4357799/} and \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737150/} for details on model formulation. The daily difference equations are thus formulated as \deqn{L_{t+1}=E_{t}-(\alpha +\gamma +\psi L_{t}^{\sigma})L_{t}} where aquatic stages mature at the constant per-capita rate \eqn{\alpha}. Mortality is given by the per-capita rate \eqn{\alpha +\gamma +\psi L_{t}^{\sigma}}, where \eqn{\gamma} describes all sources of density independent mortality and and the power-law function \eqn{\psi L_{t}^{\sigma}} describes mortality rates as a function of mean density and \eqn{\psi} represents increase in per-capita mortality in response to crowding. For \eqn{\sigma = 1} the relationship gives mean crowding, which is analogous to the classical first-order description of density dependence as described by the logistic growth equation.

\section{\strong{Constructor}}{

\itemize{
\item alpha_new = 0.1: daily mautration rate of aquatic stages (1/alpha is expected duration of aquatic life stages)
\item psi_new = 0.01: density dependent mortality; increase in per-capita mortality in response to crowding (unit given as 1/L)
\item gamma_new = 0.1: daily density independent mortality rate
\item sigma_new = 1: scaling relationship of density dependence in response to crowding

# MASH-MACRO

## Work Queue:

1. PfSI
  * Work on output (need to add initialize_output_PfSI_HumanPop to HumanPop as specific instantiation of generic initialize_output_pathogen method)
 
2. Move
  * Humans need to take care of their own output. So the HumanPop needs a variable conMove, conPathogen, maybe conEvent(?) in order to write output.
  * Work on output (need to add initialize_output_move_HumanPop to HumanPop as specific instantiation of generic initialize_output_move method)
